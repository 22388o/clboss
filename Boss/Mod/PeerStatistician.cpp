/*
An important consideration in designing metrics for
whether a peer is bad or not, is to ensure that a
clever hacker cannot costlessly game those metrics
to hurt their competitors, or artificially improve
their own.

This eliminates one particular class of data:

* Payment forwards that failed.

This is because this metric is costlessly gameable.

If I use, for example, the metric "successful
forwards divided by total forwards", then the "total
forwards" is the sum of "failed forwards" (which is
trivially gameable!) plus "successful forwards".
A savvy hacker can then destroy this metric of a
competitor by picking random hashes, then sending
payments to the competitor, which the competitor
cannot claim.
This would then be a "failed forward" from my
point-of-view, since I cannot read the onion-wrapped
error message of the peer.

Thus, we can only use:

* Data from our own actions, e.g. payments from us,
  such as from the `SendpayResultMonitor`.
  Since this is our own action, others cannot
  game this data.
  * ***Unless*** they can influence our actions!
    For example, if we are a custodial service
    (which is evil, but CLBOSS needs to support
    custodial services until their operators see
    the light and stop being evil), then our
    victims can fight back by creating artificial
    invoices that have routehints pointing to our
    peers that they want to attack, but referring
    to nonexistent channels to nonexistent nodes.
    The victim then asks us to withdraw funds
    using this artificial invoice.
    The peer would have to fail those invoices,
    and that would artificially reduce reasonable
    metrics of that peer.
  * So we support a `clboss-ignorepay` command,
    which you have to issue *before* performing a
    `pay` from an invoice provided by one of your
    victims.
    This tells CLBOSS that a `pay` command with
    specific hash (which you can extract by
    `decodepay`) was not performed by your own
    volition (i.e. third-party gameable) and should
    be ignored by the peer statistician.
* Fees earned from successful forwards.
  * Number of successful forwards is gameable, by
    paying tiny inconsequential amounts.
  * Actual substantial fees on successful forwards
    are effectively bribes by the "attacker" for us
    to maintain channels to our peers.
    Since our entire point for existence is to earn
    money by maintaining channels with our peers,
    such subsidy would be something we want to keep
    on coming in, at least until the attacker runs
    out of subsidy.
    i.e. it is "free money" for us, so sure, we will
    play along and keep on getting free money.

Another wrinkle here is that we count a payment we
initiated as a "success" if it reached the destination
at all.
Even if the payment failed at the destination, this
module still counts that as a success.
After all, this module is responsible for evaluating
peers for how good they are at getting payments sent
to our destinations, and any problems at the
destination are definitely not the fault of the peer.

For example, consider an MPP payment.
Some number of payments reached the destination via a
particularly "good" peer, but because some of our
*other* peers are unreliable, the entire payment
fails because the sub-payments sent via the other
unreliable peers failed.
We should still count the peer that managed to get
their sub-payment to the destination as "good".

This also allows us to work with active probing
modules without requiring specific support for those.
Active probing simply means generating routes to
random nodes on the network, getting a random hash,
and trying to reach the node via the route using the
random hash.
If the trial payment reaches the destination, that
means the route to it is fairly reliable, and also
that direct peer on that route is probably fairly
reliable.
